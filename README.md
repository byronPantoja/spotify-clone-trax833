# NextJS / TypeScript / ChakraUI / Prisma / Heroku

A Spotify clone project taught by Scott Moss - Frontend Masters

## Notes

- work with seed data in you db vs static data on local if your final product will actually be using a db
  - most of your time as dev is handling loading, so developing with seed data allows you to develop as close to your production env as possible
- Prisma Commands:
  - npx prisma migrate dev
  - npx prisma migrate reset
  - npx prisma db seed
  - npx prisma db push
  - npx prisma studio

## Todo

- run through tutorial and complete build
- create new project using Tailwind css instead of Chakra
- change database schema

  - cafe?
  - flowershop?
  - tattooDB?
  - Beauty Products?
